# SQL Database Project

## Project Overview
 
This project analyzes airline data using SQL queries to gain insights into flight cancellations, seat allocations, booking trends, fare conditions, aircraft utilization, and airport performance.
 
## Key Objectives
 
Identify flight cancellation patterns and reasons.
 
Analyze seat allocations and fare conditions for pricing optimization.
 
Track departure and arrival trends for operational efficiency.
 
Evaluate airport performance and flight frequency.
 
Identify least and highest paying passengers for revenue analysis.
 
 
## Data Analysis & Insights
 
Flight Cancellations: Analyzed first canceled flights date-wise and top Airbus cancellations.
 
Seat Allocation & Fare Conditions: Assessed business class seat distribution and passenger preferences.
 
Flight Trends: Identified longest flights, morning vs. evening departures, and earliest flights per airport.
 
Airport Performance: Evaluated busiest and least active airports with SQL queries.
 
 
## SQL Techniques Used
 
Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER JOIN)
 
Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX)
 
Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
 
CTEs and Subqueries for complex data extraction
 
Date Functions for time-based analysis
 
 
## Business Impact
 
This SQL-driven analysis helps airlines improve flight scheduling, pricing strategies, airport efficiency, and revenue management.
 
## Tools Used
 
SQL (PostgreSQL Server)
 
DBMS for Query Execution
